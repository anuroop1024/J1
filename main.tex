I am an astute lecturer, researcher  and an electronics engineer with over 10 years of experience, and I am greatly interested in having a discussion with you about this job opening. Please find my CV attached for your review. After many years of active academic involvement in various topics of electronics and with an innate ability to combine innovative thinking with conceptual understanding and strategic mindset, I have decided to continue my career in teaching and leading R\&D projects, where I can mentor the next generation of industry professionals. To date, I have acted as a Research Fellow, Lecturer, Senior Tutor and Teaching Assistant roles at Victoria University, Waikato Institute of Technology and Massey University in New Zealand, where I have brought repeated success in the design, development, and management of numerous Electrical and Electronics courses, specifically focused on RF communication design, product design, multi-layer PCB design, and equipment-prototype creation in digital electronics. The number of recognition I have received to date prove my expert-level ability to plan, develop, and conduct lectures, and E-learning modules. With win-win collaboration with both academic institutions and industry, it is possible to implement R\&D initiatives that are innovative and contributing to the needs of the society.
\\Throughout these 10 years, I have proven this, with an outstanding track record of establishing and nurturing cooperation with electronics companies that entrusted my course students to drive their R\&D initiatives forward. In addition to supervising research methodology development, an organisation of actual experiments, and teamwork as such, I have excelled at compiling and delivering technical reports, papers, presentations. \\I hence invite you to review the attached CV to become familiar with my long list of skills, responsibilities, and achievements in more detail. I am currently looking for new career challenges and find that this role would suit my aspirations very well. I am in search of a dynamic environment where I may utilise my gained expertise and have a direct impact on the institutionâ€™s branding and awareness, with regards to top-level electronics courses and delivered R\&D initiatives. I would welcome the opportunity to meet with you for an in-depth discussion.\\
Thank you for your time and consideration.
